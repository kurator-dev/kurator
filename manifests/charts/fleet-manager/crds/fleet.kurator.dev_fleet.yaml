                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"

                                              Also, we define an eligible domain as
                                              a domain whose nodes meet the requirements
                                              of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                              e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname",
                                              each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                              And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone",
                                              each zone is a domain of that topology.
                                              It's a required field.

                                              any location, but giving higher precedence
                                              to topologies that would help reduce
                                              the skew. A constraint is considered

                                              spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3

                                              is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod
                                              can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3)
                                              to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1)
