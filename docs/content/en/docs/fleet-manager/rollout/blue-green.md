  A comprehensive guide on Kurator's Blue/Green Deployment, providing an overview and quick start guide.
---

## Introduction

In Blue/Green Deployment, there are two separate live production environments - the blue environment and the green environment. The blue environment runs the existing version receiving real-time traffic, while the green environment hosts the new release. At any given time, only one of the environments is live with real traffic.

The key benefit of Blue/Green Deployment is that if issues arise in the new version, traffic can be instantaneously switched back to the blue environment running the old version, avoiding any downtime and resulting losses. This allows seamless rollback to the previous known-good release in the event validation fails.

- **Use Case**: If issues are encountered that prevent the new version from functioning properly, the testing process should immediately switch the traffic back to the previously stable legacy release. This ensures users continue receiving an optimal service experience without interruption while the new release issues are addressed.
- **Functionality**: Provides configuration of Blue/Green Deployment and triggers a Blue/Green Deploymenton new release.

By allowing users to deploy applications and their Blue/Green Deployment configurations in a single place, Kurator streamlines Blue/Green Deployment through automated GitOps workflows for unified deployment and validation.

## Prerequisites

In the subsequent sections, we'll guide you through a hands-on demonstration.

These are some of the prerequisites needed to use Kurator Rollout:

### Kubernetes Clusters

Kubernetes v1.27.3 or higher is supported.
  
You can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create clusters as needed.
It is recommended to use [Kurator's scripts](https://kurator.dev/docs/setup/install-cluster-operator/#setup-kubernetes-clusters-with-kind) to create multi-clusters environment.

Notes: You can find the mapping between Kind node image versions and Kubernetes versions on [Kind Release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases). Additionally, the website provides a lookup table showing compatible Kind and node image versions.

### Istio

Istio v1.18 or higher is supported.

It is recommended to install Istio using istioctl. Refer to [istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/diagnostic-tools/istioctl/) for instructions on installing istioctl.

After installing istioctl, you can install Istio using the following commands:

```console
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istioctl manifest install --set profile=default
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get po -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system         istio-ingressgateway-65b5c9f9bb-8w5ml                   1/1     Running   0          37s
istio-system         istiod-657f7686cf-hshwp                                 1/1     Running   0          2m5s
```

### Prometheus

Kurator needs to use Prometheus to collect metrics on monitored resources in the cluster, which will be used as the basis for determining whether to continue rolling out.

You can install Prometheus using the following commands:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.20/samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get po -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system         prometheus-5d5d6d6fc-5hxbh                              2/2     Running   0          91s
```

Notes: It is recommended to change the release in the above commands to match the version of Istio that was already installed.

### Ingress Gateway

To allow external programs access to the services you've deployed, you will need to create an IngressGateway resource.

You can create an ingress gateway using the following commands:

```console
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: public-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "*"
EOF
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get gateway -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system   public-gateway   17s
```

### Kurator Rollout Plugin

Before delving into the how to Perform a Unified Rollout, ensure you have successfully installed the Rollout plugin as outlined in the  [Rollout plugin installation guide](/docs/fleet-manager/rollout/rollout-plugin/).

## How to Perform a Unified Rollout

### Configuring the Rollout Policy

You can initiate the process by deploying a application demo using the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -f examples/rollout/blue_green.yaml
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get application blue-green-demo -oyaml
```

The expected result should be:

```console
apiVersion: apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  annotations:

```

Given the output provided, let's dive deeper to understand the various elements and their implications:

- Kurator allows customizing Rollout strategies under the `Spec.syncPolicies.rollout` section for services deployed via kustomization. It will establish and implement Blue/Green Deployment for these services according to the configuration defined here.
- The `workload` defines the target resource for the Blue/Green Deployment. The `kind` specifies the resource type, which can be either deployment or daemonset.
- The `serviceName` and `port` specify the name of the service for the workload as well as the exposed port number.
- The `trafficAnalysis` section defines the configuration for evaluating a new release version's health and readiness during a rollout process.
    - The `checkFailedTimes` parameter specifies the maximum number of failed check results allowed throughout the Blue/Green Deployment lifecycle.
    - `checkIntervalSeconds` denotes the time interval between consecutive health evaluation checks.
    - The `metrics` identify the metrics that will be monitored to determine the deployment's health status. Currently, only `request-success-rate` and `request-duration` two built-in metric types are supported.
    - The `webhooks` provide an extensibility mechanism for the analysis procedures. In this configuration, webhooks communicate with the testloader to generate test traffic for the healthchecks.
- The `trafficRouting` configuration specifies how traffic will be shifted to the Blue/Green Deployment during the rollout process.
    - The `analysisTimes` signifies the number of testing iterations that will be conducted.
    - The `gateways` and `host` represent the ingress points for external and internal service traffic, respectively.
- The `rolloutStatus` section displays the actual processing status of rollout within the fleet.

About a minute after submitting this configuration, you can check the rollout status by running the following command:

```conole
kubectl get canary -n webapp --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
backend   Initialized   0        2024-01-13T07:48:10Z
```

If the status shows as `Initialized`, it means the initialization of rollout process has completed successfully.

**Notes**: In the above configuration, we set the `kustomization.interval` to 0s. This disables Fluxcd's periodic synchronization of configurations between the local mirror and cluster. The reason is that Flagger needs to modify the replica counts in Deployments to complete its initialization process. If you are uncertain whether the replicas for all applications in your deployments are set to zero, it is recommended to also set `kustomization.interval` to 0s.

### Trigger Rollout

#### Automated Rollout

A Blue/Green Deployment can be triggered by either updating the container image referenced in the git repository configuration, or directly updating the image of the deployment resource locally in the Kubernetes cluster.

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get canary -n webapp -w --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
backend   Initialized   0        2024-01-16T08:53:40Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-16T08:55:10Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-16T08:56:40Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-16T08:58:10Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-16T08:59:40Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-16T09:01:10Z
backend   Promoting     0        2024-01-16T09:02:40Z
backend   Finalising    0        2024-01-16T09:04:10Z
backend   Succeeded     0        2024-01-16T09:05:40Z
```

{{< image width="100%"
link="./image/blue-green-successful.svg"
>}}

- As shown in the diagram, after triggering a Blue/Green Deployment, the Kurator Rollout Plugin will first create pod(s) for the new version.
- The new version will then undergo multiple test iterations. During this testing period, all incoming requests will be routed to the new version. Various testing metrics will be evaluated to determine the health and stability of the new release.
- Upon validating the new version through testing and confirming it is ready for release, Kurator will proceed to replace the old version with the new version across the entire cluster. And redirect all incoming traffic to the primary pod.
- It will then remove the canary pod, completing the rollout process.

```console
kubectl get application rolllout-demo -oyaml

rolloutStatus:
      backupNameInCluster: backend
      backupStatusInCluster:
        canaryWeight: 0
        conditions:
        - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-16T09:05:40Z"
          lastUpdateTime: "2024-01-16T09:05:40Z"
          message: Canary analysis completed successfully, promotion finished.
          reason: Succeeded
          status: "True"
          type: Promoted
        failedChecks: 1
        iterations: 0
        lastAppliedSpec: 7b779dcc48
        lastPromotedSpec: 7b779dcc48
        lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-16T09:05:40Z"
        phase: Succeeded
        trackedConfigs: {}
      clusterName: kurator-member1
```

A Blue/Green Deployment is triggered by changes in any of the following objects:

- Deployment PodSpec (container image, command, ports, env, resources, etc)
- ConfigMaps mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables
- Secrets mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables

**Notes:** If you apply new changes to the deployment during the analysis, Kurator Rollout will restart the analysis.

#### Automated Rollback

If the new version fails testing during the blue/green deployment, Kurator will automatically roll back to the previous version to ensure continuous service operations.

During the analysis you can generate HTTP 500 errors and high latency to test Kurator's rollback.

Exec into the testlaoder pod to generate HTTP 500 errors and Generate latency.

```console
kubectl -n webapp exec -it backend-testloader-5f7bcd85bb-6bgdd sh

watch curl http://backend-canary.webapp:9898/status/500

watch curl http://backend-canary.webapp:9898/delay/1
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get canary -n webapp -w --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
backend   Initialized   0        2024-01-13T08:06:10Z

- As shown in the diagram, after triggering a Blue/Green Deployment, the Kurator Rollout Plugin will first create pod(s) for the new version.
- During the testing period, all traffic will be incrementally routed to the Green version. A variety of testing metrics will be collected from this live environment validation.
- If the number of errors or failures encountered during testing exceeds the `checkFailedTimes`, all traffic will automatically be rerouted back to the original stable version.
- It will then remove the canary pod, completing the rollback process.

```console
kubectl get application rolllout-demo -oyaml

```

## Cleanup

### 1.Cleanup the Rollout Policy

If you only need to remove the Rollout Policy, simply edit the current application and remove the corresponding description:

```console
kubectl edit applicaiton blue-green-demo
```

To check the results of the deletion, you can observe that the rollout-related pods have been removed:

```console
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member2.config
```

If you want to configure a Blue/Green Deployment for it again, you can simply edit the application and add the necessary configurations.

### 2.Cleanup the Application

When the application is delete, all associated resources will also be reomved:

```console
kubectl delete application abtesting-demo
```
