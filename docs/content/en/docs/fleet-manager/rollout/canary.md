  A comprehensive guide on Kurator's Canary Deployment, providing an overview and quick start guide.
---

## Introduction

Canary Deployment is a software release strategy.
It refers to releasing a new software version to only a very small percentage of users first for testing, to observe if there are any issues. Based on the test results, determine whether to gradually roll out the release to more users.
It aims to maximize reducing the impact on users after a new version goes live. It is considered a safer and more reliable method of software updates.

- **Use Case**: When the system undergoes API changes that require validation through real-world usage, a Canary Deployment should be leveraged to gradually roll out and validate the changes. This incremental approach helps ensure any potential issues are identified and addressed before being exposed to all services/traffic.
- **Functionality**: Provides configuration of Canary Deployment and triggers a Canary Deployment on new release.

By allowing users to deploy applications and their canary configurations in a single place, Kurator streamlines Canary Deployment through automated GitOps workflows for unified deployment and validation.

## prerequisites

In the subsequent sections, we'll guide you through a hands-on demonstration.

These are some of the prerequisites needed to use Kurator Rollout:

### Kubernetes Clusters

Kubernetes v1.27.3 or higher is supported.
  
You can use [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to create clusters as needed.
It is recommended to use [Kurator's scripts](https://kurator.dev/docs/setup/install-cluster-operator/#setup-kubernetes-clusters-with-kind) to create multi-clusters environment.

Notes: You can find the mapping between Kind node image versions and Kubernetes versions on [Kind Release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases). Additionally, the website provides a lookup table showing compatible Kind and node image versions.

### Istio

Istio v1.18 or higher is supported.

It is recommended to install Istio using istioctl. Refer to [istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/diagnostic-tools/istioctl/) for instructions on installing istioctl.

After installing istioctl, you can install Istio using the following commands:

```console
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istioctl manifest install --set profile=default
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get po -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system         istio-ingressgateway-65b5c9f9bb-8w5ml                   1/1     Running   0          37s
istio-system         istiod-657f7686cf-hshwp                                 1/1     Running   0          2m5s
```

### Prometheus

Kurator needs to use Prometheus to collect metrics on monitored resources in the cluster, which will be used as the basis for determining whether to continue rolling out.

You can install Prometheus using the following commands:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.20/samples/addons/prometheus.yaml
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get po -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system         prometheus-5d5d6d6fc-5hxbh                              2/2     Running   0          91s
```

Notes: It is recommended to change the release in the above commands to match the version of Istio that was already installed.

### Ingress Gateway

To allow external programs access to the services you've deployed, you will need to create an IngressGateway resource.

You can create an ingress gateway using the following commands:

```console
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: public-gateway
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "*"
EOF
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get gateway -n istio-system --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

istio-system   public-gateway   17s
```

### Kurator Rollout Plugin

Before delving into the how to Perform a Unified Rollout, ensure you have successfully installed the Rollout plugin as outlined in the  [Rollout plugin installation guide](/docs/fleet-manager/rollout/rollout-plugin/).

## How to Perform a Unified Rollout

### Configuring the Rollout Policy

You can initiate the process by deploying a application demo using the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -f examples/rollout/canary.yaml
```

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get application rollout-demo -oyaml
```

The expected result should be:

```console
apiVersion: apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1","kind":"Application","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"rollout-demo","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"source":{"gitRepository":{"interval":"3m0s","ref":{"branch":"master"},"timeout":"1m0s","url":"https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo"}},"syncPolicies":[{"destination":{"fleet":"quickstart"},"kustomization":{"interval":"0s","path":"./deploy/webapp","prune":true,"timeout":"2m0s"},"rollout":{"port":9898,"rolloutPolicy":{"rolloutTimeoutSeconds":600,"trafficAnalysis":{"checkFailedTimes":2,"checkIntervalSeconds":90,"metrics":[{"intervalSeconds":90,"name":"request-success-rate","thresholdRange":{"min":99}},{"intervalSeconds":90,"name":"request-duration","thresholdRange":{"max":500}}],"webhooks":{"command":["hey -z 1m -q 10 -c 2 http://backend-canary.webapp:9898/"],"timeoutSeconds":60}},"trafficRouting":{"canaryStrategy":{"maxWeight":50,"stepWeight":10},"gateways":["istio-system/public-gateway"],"hosts":["backend.webapp"],"timeoutSeconds":60}},"serviceName":"backend","testLoader":true,"trafficRoutingProvider":"istio","workload":{"apiVersion":"apps/v1","kind":"Deployment","name":"backend","namespace":"webapp"}}},{"destination":{"fleet":"quickstart"},"kustomization":{"interval":"5m0s","path":"./kustomize","prune":true,"targetNamespace":"default","timeout":"2m0s"}}]}}

```

Given the output provided, let's dive deeper to understand the various elements and their implications:

- Kurator allows customizing Rollout strategies under the `Spec.syncPolicies.rollout` section for services deployed via kustomization or helmrelease. It will establish and implement Canary Deployment for these services according to the configuration defined here.
- The `workload` defines the target resource for the Canary Deployment. The `kind` specifies the resource type, which can be either deployment or daemonset.
- The `serviceName` and `port` specify the name of the service for the workload as well as the exposed port number.
- The `trafficAnalysis` section defines the configuration for evaluating a new release version's health and readiness during a rollout process.
    - The `checkFailedTimes` parameter specifies the maximum number of failed check results allowed throughout the Canary Deployment lifecycle.
    - `checkIntervalSeconds` denotes the time interval between consecutive health evaluation checks.
    - The `metrics` identify the metrics that will be monitored to determine the deployment's health status. Currently, only `request-success-rate` and `request-duration` two built-in metric types are supported.
    - The `webhooks` provide an extensibility mechanism for the analysis procedures. In this configuration, webhooks communicate with the testloader to generate test traffic for the healthchecks.
- The `trafficRouting` configuration specifies how traffic will be shifted to the canary deployment during the rollout process.
    - The `maxWeight` parameter defines the maximum percentage of traffic that can be routed to the canary before promotion.
    - `stepWeight` determines the incremental amount by which traffic will be increased after each successful analysis iteration, allowing the canary to be validated under a gradually growing proportion of real-world load. Kurator also supports configuring both the traffic settings for the full release after validation completes, as well as non-graduated traffic shifts during the testing period. Please refer to [Application API Reference](https://kurator.dev/docs/references/app-api/#apps.kurator.dev/v1alpha1.CanaryConfig) for more details on directly setting the release and test traffic distributions.
    - The `gateways` and `host` represent the ingress points for external and internal service traffic, respectively.
- The `rolloutStatus` section displays the actual processing status of rollout within the fleet.

About a minute after submitting this configuration, you can check the rollout status by running the following command:

```conole
kubectl get canary -n webapp --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
backend   Initialized   0        2024-01-11T02:40:40Z
```

If the status shows as `Initialized`, it means the initialization of rollout process has completed successfully.

**Notes**: In the above configuration, we set the `kustomization.interval` to 0s. This disables Fluxcd's periodic synchronization of configurations between the local mirror and cluster. The reason is that Flagger needs to modify the replica counts in Deployments to complete its initialization process. If you are uncertain whether the replicas for all applications in your deployments are set to zero, it is recommended to also set `kustomization.interval` to 0s.

### Trigger Rollout

A Canary Deployment can be triggered by either updating the container image referenced in the git repository configuration, or directly updating the image of the deployment resource locally in the Kubernetes cluster.

Review the results:

```console
kubectl get canary -n webapp -w --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config

NAME      STATUS        WEIGHT   LASTTRANSITIONTIME
backend   Initialized   0        2024-01-11T02:40:40Z
backend   Progressing   0        2024-01-11T09:01:40Z
backend   Progressing   10       2024-01-11T09:03:10Z
backend   Progressing   10       2024-01-11T09:04:40Z
backend   Progressing   20       2024-01-11T09:06:10Z
backend   Progressing   30       2024-01-11T09:07:40Z
backend   Progressing   40       2024-01-11T09:09:10Z
backend   Progressing   50       2024-01-11T09:10:40Z
backend   Promoting     0        2024-01-11T09:12:10Z
backend   Finalising    0        2024-01-11T09:13:40Z
backend   Succeeded     0        2024-01-11T09:15:10Z
```

- As shown in the diagram, after triggering a canary deployment, the Kurator Rollout Plugin will first create pod(s) for the new version.
- It will then gradually shift traffic to the new version pod by increasing its traffic weight in the result metric over time. This `WEIGHT`  in the displayed result represents the current percentage of traffic accessing the new version pod during the analysis.
- Upon validating the new version through testing and confirming it is ready for release, Kurator will proceed to replace the old version with the new version across the entire cluster.
- It will then remove the canary pod, completing the rollout process.

```console
kubectl get application rolllout-demo -oyaml

rolloutStatus:
  rolloutNameInCluster: backend
  rolloutStatusInCluster:
    canaryWeight: 0
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-11T09:15:10Z"
      lastUpdateTime: "2024-01-11T09:15:10Z"
      message: Canary analysis completed successfully, promotion finished.
      reason: Succeeded
      status: "True"
      type: Promoted
    failedChecks: 1
    iterations: 0
    lastAppliedSpec: 7b779dcc48
    lastPromotedSpec: 7b779dcc48
    lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-11T09:15:10Z"
    phase: Succeeded
    trackedConfigs: {}
  clusterName: kurator-member1
```

A canary deployment is triggered by changes in any of the following objects:

- Deployment PodSpec (container image, command, ports, env, resources, etc)
- ConfigMaps mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables
- Secrets mounted as volumes or mapped to environment variables

**Notes:** If you apply new changes to the deployment during the canary analysis, Kurator Rollout will restart the analysis.

## Cleanup

### 1.Cleanup the Rollout Policy

If you only need to remove the Rollout Policy, simply edit the current application and remove the corresponding description:

```console
kubectl edit applicaiton rollout-demo
```

To check the results of the deletion, you can observe that the rollout-related pods have been removed:

```console
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member1.config
kubectl get po -A --kubeconfig=/root/.kube/kurator-member2.config
```

If you want to configure a canary deployment for it again, you can simply edit the application and add the necessary configurations.

### 2.Cleanup the Application

When the application is delete, all associated resources will also be reomved:

```console
kubectl delete application rollout-demo
```
